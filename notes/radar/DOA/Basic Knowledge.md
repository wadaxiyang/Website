## Array Signal
Array signals not only acquire the frequency domain and time domain characteristics of signals as a single sensor would, but they can also extract spatial domain characteristics of the signals. More importantly, they can utilize these spatial properties to enhance desired signals, suppress interference and noise due to their superior signal gain, better beam steering capability, and higher spatial resolution compared to individual sensors.
